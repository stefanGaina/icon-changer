# icon-changer
*icon-changer* is a lightweight Windows x86_64 tool for changing an executable's icon.

# Usage
You can *download the latest released binary* from [here](https://github.com/stefanGaina/icon-changer/releases) or build from source (instructions are [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

To execute run ```icon-changer path/to/icon path/to/executable```.

Icon can be in **ICO** format (recommended) or in **BMP** format. Images can be converted to **ICO** format.

The executable needs to be in **EXE** format and it is recommended to not have an icon already (this will be improved in upcoming releases).
